https://gun.eco/ mentions HAM CRDT
  GUN is an ecosystem of modular tools. Graphs take you beyond just immutable hashes, they let you do realtime multiplayer updates on any type of data. SEA gives you the best local-first secure user accounts, but with normal logins and even p2p password resets using 3FA!

  70%+ cost savings

  AXE will let you deploy without clouds to a decentralized edge CDN for your JAMstack apps. It runs everywhere, even via browsers with WebRTC, using the simple yet powerful HAM "CRDT" conflict resolution algorithm. Meanwhile, DAM let's you do offline mesh networking and RAD stores your data.
